# Is the runningback position losing value in the NFL and becoming less relevant in fantasy football as a result? 
## By Angel Moreno

The purpose of this analysis is to either confirm or refute the suspicion that runningbacks are losing value in the NFL. It's no secret that runningbacks
are being paid less than they were in the past, but here analyze their perfomance in terms of game stats and fantasy points throughout the years. I
compare RB stats and fantasy points overtime with those of QBs, WRs, and TEs. This analysis focuses on fantasy points, yards, touchdowns, and games
started. Finally, look for signs of adaptation to today's offensive schemes. That is, I analyze the proportion of RB points that come from rushing and 
receiving to see if the proportion changes as well.
